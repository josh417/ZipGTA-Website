# ZipGTA : What is this project?
ZipGTA Is a website which allows members of the GrandTheftArma community to calculate how much it'll cost for a variety of my services. It features 3 different forms of calculator which will give the in-game value of the items they are wishing to purchase.

Website Features & Services:
- Level Calculator (Calculates the cost of levelling up)
- Credit Buying Service (Calculates the real-time cost of buying credits which can vary depending on the market)
- XP Selling Service (Calculates the amount the player can earn from selling XP Rewards, the amount varies depending on how many they have to sell)
- Vehicle Upgrade Service (Shows the live stock of what vehicle upgrades are for sale)


The project was designed to test my front-end capabilities as this is a weakpoint for me.
